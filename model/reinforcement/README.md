## Best Practices

### 1. Data Preparation
- Ensure your trading data is properly formatted (OHLCV columns)
- Use sufficient historical data (recommended: 1000+ data points)
- Consider data quality and remove outliers if necessary

### 2. Training Guidelines
- Start with shorter training sessions (100-500 episodes) for initial testing
- Use evaluation intervals to monitor progress
- Save models regularly to prevent loss of progress
- Monitor for overfitting using validation data

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Start with provided optimal configurations
- Adjust learning rates based on training stability
- Tune exploration parameters for your specific data
- Use grid search or automated tuning for optimal results

### 4. Production Deployment
- Always evaluate models thoroughly before deployment
- Use ensemble methods for improved robustness
- Monitor performance in live trading scenarios
- Implement proper risk management and position sizing
