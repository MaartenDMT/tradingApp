# Model Cleanup Summary

## Files Moved to Archive Directory

The following unused model files have been moved to `archive/model/`:

1. `models_optimized.py` - Not used (models.py is used instead)
2. `models_original_backup.py` - Backup file not used in the application
3. `exampletab.py` - Example file not used in the application

## Files Still in Use

The following model files are currently being used in the application:

1. `models.py` - Main models file imported in main.py
2. `bot_system.py` - Bot system implementation
3. `features.py` - Trading features implementation
4. `__init__.py` - Package initialization
5. `manualtrading/` - Manual trading modules
6. `ml_system/` - Machine learning system modules
7. `reinforcement/` - Reinforcement learning modules
8. `rl_system/` - Reinforcement learning system modules

## Analysis

All the files moved to the archive directory were identified as unused because:
1. They are not imported in the main application entry point (main.py)
2. They are not referenced anywhere else in the codebase
3. They are duplicates, backups, or example files

The application will continue to function normally as all currently used models remain in place.
