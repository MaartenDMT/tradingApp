# Fix for OpenAI Gym Warning

## Problem
The application was showing a warning message:
```
2025-09-11 14:34:24,841 - env - WARNING - OpenAI Gym not available. Environment registration skipped.
```

## Root Cause
The application was trying to import from the older `gym` package using:
```python
from gym.envs.registration import register
```

However, the system had both `gym` (0.26.2) and the newer `gymnasium` (0.29.1) installed. The code was failing to import from `gym` for some reason, causing the environment registration to be skipped.

## Solution
Updated the import in `model/reinforcement/environments/trading_environment.py` to try both `gymnasium` and `gym` imports:

```python
# Try gymnasium first (newer version)
try:
    from gymnasium.envs.registration import register
except ImportError:
    # Fall back to gym (older version)
    from gym.envs.registration import register
```

## Verification
After the fix, the warning is gone and we can see successful environment registration:
```
2025-09-11 18:06:12,295 - env - INFO - Context7 trading environments registered successfully
2025-09-11 18:06:12,295 - env - INFO - Available: trading-v2 (max_steps=1000)
2025-09-11 18:06:12,295 - env - INFO - Available: trading-professional-v2 (max_steps=252)
```

This confirms that the trading environments are now properly registered and available for use in the reinforcement learning system.
