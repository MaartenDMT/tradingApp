## Analysis

All the files moved to the archive directory were identified as unused because:
1. They are not imported in the main `views.py` file
2. They are not referenced anywhere else in the codebase
3. They are duplicates or older versions of currently used files

The application will continue to function normally as all currently used views remain in place.
