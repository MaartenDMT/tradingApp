# Trading Application - Execution Summary\n\nThis document provides a summary of the files and scripts that have been created to make it easier to run the trading application.\n\n## New Files Created\n\n1. **Makefile** - For Unix/Linux/macOS users\n   - Provides commands to setup, run, and manage the application\n   - Usage: `make setup` and `make run`\n\n2. **run.ps1** - PowerShell script for Windows users\n   - Provides the same functionality as the Makefile but for Windows PowerShell\n   - Usage: `.\run.ps1 setup` and `.\run.ps1 run`\n\n3. **run.bat** - Batch script for Windows users who prefer command prompt\n   - Provides the same functionality as the Makefile but for Windows Command Prompt\n   - Usage: `run.bat setup` and `run.bat run`\n\n4. **requirements_simple.txt** - Simplified dependencies file\n   - Contains only the essential dependencies without conda-specific paths\n   - Updated to use CUDA-compatible PyTorch (torch-cu124)\n   - Used by the helper scripts to create a clean virtual environment\n\n5. **EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md** - This summary file explaining all the new scripts\n\n## How to Use\n\n### For Unix/Linux/macOS Users:\n1. Run `make setup` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies\n2. Run `make run` to start the application\n\n### For Windows Users (PowerShell):\n1. Run `.\run.ps1 setup` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies\n2. Run `.\run.ps1 run` to start the application\n\n### For Windows Users (Command Prompt):\n1. Run `run.bat setup` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies\n2. Run `run.bat run` to start the application\n\n## Available Commands\n\nAll three script formats support the following commands:\n- `setup` - Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies\n- `run` - Run the trading application\n- `install-deps` - Install all required dependencies\n- `clean` - Remove the virtual environment\n- `test` - Run tests (if available)\n- `lint` - Run code linting (if available)\n- `update-deps` - Update dependencies to latest versions\n- `dev-setup` - Install development tools and setup environment\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Simplified Setup**: One command to set up the entire environment\n2. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Unix/Linux/macOS and Windows\n3. **Clean Environment**: Creates an isolated virtual environment\n4. **Easy Management**: Easy to install, update, and clean dependencies\n5. **Development Tools**: Includes commands for testing and linting\n6. **CUDA Support**: Uses CUDA-compatible PyTorch for GPU acceleration (torch-cu124)\n\n## CUDA Support\n\nThe application now uses CUDA-compatible PyTorch (torch-cu124) which provides GPU acceleration for machine learning tasks. This is especially beneficial for the reinforcement learning components and machine learning models that can take advantage of GPU processing power.\n\nTo use CUDA:\n1. Ensure you have NVIDIA CUDA 12.4 installed on your system\n2. Run the setup scripts as usual\n3. The application will automatically use GPU acceleration when available\n\nIf you don't have CUDA installed or want to use CPU-only PyTorch, you can modify the requirements_simple.txt file to use the CPU version instead.
