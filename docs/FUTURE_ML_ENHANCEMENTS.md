# Future ML Enhancement Roadmap

## Latest Technology Integration Plan

### 1. Reinforcement Learning Integration
Based on Stable-Baselines3 latest features:

```python
# Example: Advanced RL Trading Agent
from stable_baselines3 import PPO, SAC
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv

class TradingRLAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Multi-algorithm ensemble for different market conditions
        self.ppo_agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
        self.sac_agent = SAC("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)

    def adaptive_training(self):
        # Use PPO for trending markets, SAC for volatile markets
        pass
```

### 2. Enhanced Ensemble Methods
Latest scikit-learn 1.7.1 features:

```python
# Categorical feature support in HistGradientBoosting
from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier

model = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(
    categorical_features='auto',  # New feature
    max_iter=500,
    learning_rate=0.1
)
```

### 3. PyTorch Deep Learning Models
Modern neural architectures for financial prediction:

```python
class AdvancedTradingNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Transformer-based architecture for time series
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(...)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(...)
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(...)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Advanced architecture combining multiple approaches
        pass
```

### 4. Bayesian Optimization Enhancements
Latest scikit-optimize features:

```python
from skopt import gp_minimize
from skopt.space import Real, Integer, Categorical

# Advanced acquisition functions
result = gp_minimize(
    func=objective,
    dimensions=search_space,
    acq_func='EI',  # Expected Improvement
    n_calls=100,
    n_initial_points=10,
    acq_optimizer='lbfgs'
